      <p class="personal">
            Lexis Guru is a personalized plan for people who want to learn a foreign language on their own.
      </p>

      <p class="guru-text">
             Whether it is work, travel or just a goal to expand your horizons, it is not always easy to find time and money to take a language class or hire a tutor. However, you can learn it on your own. And now it is only a matter of knowing where to start, what materials to use and how to practice what you've learnt. Here is where Lexis Guru comes in handy- the plan that is based on your personal goals, learning style, life routine and interests.

          <p class="mystory">
            <span>Born and raised in Russia, I started learning foreign languages in middle school.
               At university my major was Linguistics and Translation and I have experience in learning such languages as: English, French, German, Latin and Chinese.
             </span> <br><br>
               I moved to the United States in 2009 and continued to improve my language skills, I've met people from all around the world and realized that my life will always be connected with learning about different cultures and languages.

        <p class="steps-text">
          In order for me to build a great learning plan I need to know few things about you. This is where we have a chance to meet. It can be a meeting in person or a video chat.
          I am looking forward to learning everything that can help me to create the best learning process for you. We will discuss your learning habits, weekly routines, interests and goals.

        <p class="steps-text">
          This is where the creation process happens. It takes from two to five days to build the plan. After it's done you will get your course of action: exercises to do,
          suggested materials and a lot of useful information. We will discuss it all and I will happily answer your questions.

        <p class="steps-text">
          Our last step is to give you some time to try it out. After a few weeks I will contact you to see how things are going with your learning process, if you have any questions or struggles.
          Let's hope you are doing great! However, I will be glad to change anything that does not fit your style.
